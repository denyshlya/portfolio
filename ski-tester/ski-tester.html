    <h1>Ski Pressure Testing System</h1>

    <p>
      A distributed force measurement system designed to characterize
      ski camber and pressure distribution under controlled loading.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Commercial ski fitting and testing tools provide limited quantitative
      insight into pressure distribution along the ski length. The goal of
      this project was to design a low-cost, scalable system capable of
      measuring localized forces across the ski surface while supporting
      repeatable loading conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The system consists of an instrumented mounting frame with
      50+ force sensors, signal conditioning electronics, a microcontroller
      for data acquisition, and a PC-based data analysis pipeline.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensor Selection & Trade-offs</h2>
    <p>
      Multiple sensing technologies were evaluated, including piezoelectric
      sensors and strain-gauge-based load cells. Cost, sensitivity at low
      loads, mechanical robustness, and channel scalability were key
      constraints influencing the final design.
    </p>

    <h2>Electronics & Firmware</h2>
    <p>
      Each sensor channel interfaces with an ADC front-end, with multiplexing
      used to scale the system beyond the native input count of the
      microcontroller. Firmware handles timed sampling, channel selection,
      and streaming of calibrated data to a host PC.
    </p>

    <h2>Calibration & Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Individual sensors were calibrated using known loads to account for
      sensor-to-sensor variation. Repeatability and hysteresis were evaluated
      to quantify measurement uncertainty across the system.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      The system successfully captured pressure profiles along the ski
      length, enabling visualization of camber characteristics under
      different loading scenarios.
    </p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned & Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved mechanical isolation between sensor channels</li>
      <li>Higher-resolution ADCs for low-force measurements</li>
      <li>Automated calibration routines</li>
    </ul>
