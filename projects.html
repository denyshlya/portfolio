    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <p>
      This page highlights selected projects demonstrating my experience
      designing, building, and troubleshooting real systems. The work
      spans embedded electronics, RF systems, instrumentation, and
      hands-on mechanical rebuilds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engineering projects focus on system design, electronics, and
      data-driven validation. Personal projects showcase mechanical
      aptitude, problem-solving, and long-term rebuild work.
