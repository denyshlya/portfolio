    <h1>FM Transceiver</h1>

    <p>
      This project was made for the Electronics Engineering program at Okanagan College in 2022. The idea was to integrate digital control architecture with RF components to create a low power 2-way FM radio (pair of walkie talkies); Below is a technical description of the project.

            <div class="drop-inner">
             <p>The FM Transceiver Pair project focuses on the development of two portable RF transceivers designed for simple two-way communication. Each device includes a user interface composed of four buttons and a single switch: a lit transmit button, a mode select button, a pair of up/down buttons, and an on/off switch. In addition to the controls, each unit incorporates a 1.3-inch display and speaker-based audio output. Because the devices are powered by removable batteries, a battery management system is included to ensure both user safety and battery protection. The project also involves testing activities, including software debugging and optimization to reduce unnecessary power consumption, as well as verification of RF performance against the project requirements.

Several scope adjustments were made over the course of the project to improve feasibility and increase the likelihood of success. An externally chargeable battery was adopted to reduce system complexity, and a single 18650 lithium-ion cell was selected due to better availability, lower cost, and higher energy density compared to lithium-polymer alternatives. Later design changes included the addition of an external ADC to simplify battery charge monitoring and reduce overall hardware and software complexity. The design was also revised to use a single speaker rather than multiple speakers in response to parts availability constraints.

                The system begins by initializing all modules and I/O ports before displaying key operating metrics on the graphical LCD. During normal operation, the transceiver remains in receive mode while continuously monitoring user inputs. The mode selection determines the function of the up and down buttons, allowing the user to change the active channel, adjust audio volume, or modify screen brightness. If the transmit button is pressed, the system temporarily switches to transmit mode and returns to receive mode once the button is released. This control loop repeats continuously to enable responsive, real-time interaction with the device.

              <p>The BATMAN battery management subsystem for the FM Transceiver project and is centered around the Texas Instruments BQ77905 battery manager IC. Its primary function is to safely manage a single 18650 Li-ion cell by providing over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, short-circuit, and temperature protection. The BATMAN IC continuously monitors cell voltage, charge/discharge current through a sense resistor, and cell temperature via an external NTC thermistor. Two external MOSFETs are driven by BATMAN to disconnect the battery from the system load when unsafe conditions are detected. Status outputs such as CHG, DSG, and LD provide the system controller with real-time information about battery and load state. In the broader scope of the project, this subsystem forms the core of the power supply block, ensuring user safety and protecting all downstream electronics. By isolating fault conditions at the battery level, BATMAN improves overall system reliability and allows the FM transceiver to operate safely from a removable high-energy Li-ion cell.</p>

             <p>The S-1172 voltage regulator stage used to condition battery power for the rest of the system. The regulator takes the protected battery output (PREBAT) and produces a stable, regulated supply rail for sensitive electronics downstream. Input and output capacitors are placed close to the device to ensure stability, suppress noise, and handle transient current demands. The ON/OFF pin allows the regulator to be cleanly enabled or disabled as part of the system power-up sequence. By regulating the inherently variable voltage of an 18650 Li-ion cell, this stage prevents brownouts and over-voltage stress on digital and RF components. In the broader scope of the project, this schematic sits directly after the BATMAN battery manager and acts as the final power conditioning step. Together, these blocks ensure the transceiver operates reliably across the full battery discharge curve.</p></div>

              <p>The battery voltage monitoring circuit measures the protected battery rail and provides a low-power, MCU-readable representation of remaining charge. A high-value resistor divider scales the battery voltage while minimizing continuous current draw. The TC75 op-amp buffers this divided signal, presenting a stable, low-impedance output that is insensitive to ADC loading. This buffered voltage is then fed into the MCP3021 I²C ADC for digitization. The ADC allows the microcontroller to periodically sample battery voltage without directly loading the battery or analog node. In the broader system, this block enables battery percentage estimation and low-battery warning functionality while preserving overall power efficiency.</p>

The resulting signals are routed directly to dedicated external interrupt pins, enabling immediate, event-driven response. One dual-switch device is used to reduce component count while maintaining independent inputs. This approach eliminates the need for constant polling and reduces processor overhead.
