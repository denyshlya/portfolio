During my time with Alberta Wildfire Communications, my role operated in two distinct modes: 
<strong>steady-state operations</strong> and <strong>active wildfire incident response</strong>.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>           
<p>In steady-state operations, I supported the province-wide communications infrastructure that 
wildfire response teams depend on year-round. This included closing service tickets in the work 
tracking system, troubleshooting site connectivity issues, coordinating generator servicing, 
diagnosing RF faults at repeater sites, and replacing damaged or degraded RF components such as 
antennas, connectors, and Daniels repeater modules. I also helped oversee a provincial transition 
to Starlink-based connectivity at remote locations, integrating Starlink terminals with Ubiquiti 
networking equipment to create reliable Wi-Fi mesh networks at communications sites across Alberta.
</p>

<p>
During active fire incidents, my responsibilities shifted toward rapid deployment communications 
and incident-camp infrastructure. I assisted with incident response camp setup by ensuring trailer 
and asset placement did not interfere with RF propagation or communications reliability. I worked 
directly with contractors to deploy mobile cellular repeater trailers equipped with ~150-foot 
portable towers, providing cellular connectivity for camps supporting up to 1,000 personnel. 
I also deployed Starlink mesh networks for command-and-control trailers and established satellite 
backhaul connectivity for Incident Command Posts.
</p>

<p>
A critical component of wildfire communications is Alberta’s provincial RF repeater system 
(FireNet), which enables long-range radio communication between aircraft, ground crews, and 
dispatch centers located in fire centers across the province. During large wildfire events, 
dispatch operations must often be relocated from permanent facilities to the incident response 
camp. This creates unique RF challenges, particularly ensuring that all aircraft communications 
are transmitted through repeated channels so communications can be logged and coordinated through 
the provincial dispatch network. In these situations, I deployed portable repeaters and integrated 
them into the existing FireNet system to extend coverage and maintain reliable communication 
between helicopters, ground crews, and dispatch operations.

DBM Communications is a small communications consulting and field-service business operating 
throughout British Columbia. Originally established as a sole proprietorship, the company provides 
RF communications, networking, and infrastructure support to municipalities, rural ISPs, and 
remote industrial clients. My role combined communications consulting, field deployment, and 
maintenance of remote RF infrastructure across challenging terrain.
</p>

<p>
A major portion of my work involved supporting municipalities in the Okanagan and Kamloops regions 
as they upgraded legacy SCADA communications systems. We acted as communications consultants, 
advising on component selection, system architecture, and infrastructure planning to ensure 
reliable operation in geographically complex environments. This included evaluating RF propagation 
constraints, planning repeater placement, and verifying system performance during deployment. 
In parallel, we supported independent rural internet service providers by troubleshooting network 
throughput limitations, optimizing wireless coverage, and performing infrastructure maintenance 
on tower-based and mountaintop communication equipment.
</p>

<p>
The other major component of my work involved annual service, maintenance, and construction 
contracts with heli-skiing operations across British Columbia. These operations require reliable 
radio communication across extremely remote and mountainous terrain so that lodge dispatchers can 
maintain continuous contact with helicopters and field staff. To enable this, a distributed network 
of RF repeater sites was installed on mountain peaks to provide both local coverage and long-range 
repeating capability between valleys and operating zones.
</p>

<p>
These repeater installations typically consisted of Daniels repeater systems powered by solar 
arrays and large battery banks, with antennas mounted above fiberglass protective enclosures that 
were tethered directly into the mountain. All sites were accessible only by helicopter, making 
preventative maintenance, troubleshooting, and construction work logistically complex and highly 
weather-dependent. My responsibilities included servicing repeater electronics, maintaining power 
systems, performing RF diagnostics, and assisting with installation and upgrades of new mountaintop 
communication sites. This work required careful planning, strong RF troubleshooting skills, and the 
ability to operate safely in remote environments where communications infrastructure is critical 
to flight operations and personnel safety.
