                During my time with Alberta Wildfire Communications, my role operated in two distinct modes:
                <strong>steady-state operations</strong> and <strong>active wildfire incident response</strong>.

                    connectivity systems at remote communications sites.

                    communications into the provincial FireNet repeater network.
                  </td>

              <p>
                In steady-state operations, I supported the province-wide communications infrastructure that wildfire response teams depend on
                year-round. This included closing service tickets in the work tracking system, troubleshooting site connectivity issues,
                coordinating generator servicing, diagnosing RF faults at repeater sites, and replacing damaged or degraded RF components such as
                antennas, connectors, and Daniels repeater modules. I also helped oversee a provincial transition to Starlink-based connectivity
                at remote locations, integrating Starlink terminals with Ubiquiti networking equipment to create reliable Wi-Fi mesh networks at
                communications sites across Alberta.
              </p>

              <p>
                During active fire incidents, my responsibilities shifted toward rapid deployment communications and incident-camp infrastructure.
                I assisted with incident response camp setup by ensuring trailer and asset placement did not interfere with RF propagation or
                communications reliability. I worked directly with contractors to deploy mobile cellular repeater trailers equipped with ~150-foot
                portable towers, providing cellular connectivity for camps supporting up to 1,000 personnel. I also deployed Starlink mesh networks
                for command-and-control trailers and established satellite backhaul connectivity for Incident Command Posts.
              </p>

              <p>
                A critical component of wildfire communications is Alberta’s provincial RF repeater system (FireNet), which enables long-range radio
                communication between aircraft, ground crews, and dispatch centers located in fire centers across the province. During large wildfire
                events, dispatch operations must often be relocated from permanent facilities to the incident response camp. This creates unique RF
                challenges, particularly ensuring that all aircraft communications are transmitted through repeated channels so communications can be
                logged and coordinated through the provincial dispatch network. In these situations, I deployed portable repeaters and integrated them
                into the existing FireNet system to extend coverage and maintain reliable communication between helicopters, ground crews, and dispatch
                operations.

              <p>
                DBM Communications is a small communications consulting and field-service business operating throughout British Columbia.
                Originally established as a sole proprietorship, the company provides RF communications, networking, and infrastructure support
                to municipalities, rural ISPs, and remote clients. My role combined communications consulting, field deployment, and maintenance
                of remote RF infrastructure across challenging terrain.
              </p>

              <p>
                A major portion of my work involved supporting municipalities in the Okanagan and Kamloops regions as they upgraded legacy SCADA
                communications systems. We acted as communications consultants, advising on component selection, system architecture, and infrastructure
                planning to ensure reliable operation in geographically complex environments. This included evaluating RF propagation constraints,
                planning repeater placement, and verifying system performance during deployment. In parallel, we supported independent rural internet
                service providers by troubleshooting network throughput limitations, optimizing wireless coverage, and performing infrastructure
                maintenance on tower-based and mountaintop communication equipment.
              </p>

              <p>
                The other major component of my work involved annual service, maintenance, and construction contracts with heli-skiing operations
                across British Columbia. These operations require reliable radio communication across extremely remote and mountainous terrain so that
                lodge dispatchers can maintain continuous contact with helicopters and field staff. To enable this, a distributed network of RF repeater
                sites was installed on mountain peaks to provide both local coverage and long-range repeating capability between valleys and operating zones.
              </p>

              <p>
                These repeater installations typically consisted of Daniels repeater systems powered by solar arrays and large battery banks, with antennas
                mounted above fiberglass protective enclosures that were tethered directly into the mountain. All sites were accessible only by helicopter,
                making preventative maintenance, troubleshooting, and construction work logistically complex and highly weather-dependent. My responsibilities
                included servicing repeater electronics, maintaining power systems, performing RF diagnostics, and assisting with installation and upgrades of
                new mountaintop communication sites. This work required careful planning, strong RF troubleshooting skills, and the ability to operate safely
                in remote environments where communications infrastructure is critical to flight operations and personnel safety.
