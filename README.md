# Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal engineering portfolio,
hosted via GitHub Pages.

The site highlights selected electrical engineering projects with a focus on
embedded systems, instrumentation, hardware design, and data-driven measurement.

## Featured Projects
**Ski Pressure Testing System**  
A distributed force measurement system designed to characterize ski camber and
pressure distribution using 135 sensors, custom electronics, embedded firmware,
and a PC-based analysis pipeline.

**FM Transceiver**  
An RF compliant FM Transceiver pair enabling voice communication over short distances.
Featuring a custom PCB controlled by a PIC24 MCU and Si4012 RF IC, custom enclosure, display and 18650 rechargable battery.
