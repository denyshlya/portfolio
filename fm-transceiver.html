    <h1>FM Transceiver</h1>

    <p>
  This project was made for the Electronics Engineering program at Okanagan College in 2022. The idea was to integrate digital control architecture with RF components to create a low power 2-way FM radio (pair of walkie talkies); Below is a technical description of the project.

        <div class="drop-inner">
          <p>The FM Transceiver project aims to create a simple, effective, wireless solution for indoor two-way communication. Two devices were designed and built, each organized around five core functional blocks: system input, RF backend, MCU support, system output, and power supply, along with a small set of supporting components. The devices use frequency modulation (FM), which offers better noise immunity and stability compared to amplitude modulation. Received audio is output through an 8 Ω speaker driven by a low-power audio amplifier. A Microchip PIC24FJ1024GB606 microcontroller is used to handle input processing and system control due to its simplicity and flexible I/O. RF communication is handled by the SI4720 transceiver, a highly integrated solution that manages all RF functions within the system.</p>

        <div class="drop-inner">
          <p>The FM Transceiver Pair project focuses on the development of two portable RF transceivers designed for simple two-way communication. Each device includes a user interface composed of four buttons and a single switch: a lit transmit button, a mode select button, a pair of up/down buttons, and an on/off switch. In addition to the controls, each unit incorporates a 1.3-inch display and speaker-based audio output. Because the devices are powered by removable batteries, a battery management system is included to ensure both user safety and battery protection. The project also involves testing activities, including software debugging and optimization to reduce unnecessary power consumption, as well as verification of RF performance against the project requirements.

Several scope adjustments were made over the course of the project to improve feasibility and increase the likelihood of success. An externally chargeable battery was adopted to reduce system complexity, and a single 18650 lithium-ion cell was selected due to better availability, lower cost, and higher energy density compared to lithium-polymer alternatives. Later design changes included the addition of an external ADC to simplify battery charge monitoring and reduce overall hardware and software complexity. The design was also revised to use a single speaker rather than multiple speakers in response to parts availability constraints.

              <p>The BATMAN battery management subsystem for the FM Transceiver project and is centered
                around the Texas Instruments BQ77905 battery manager IC. 
                Its primary function is to safely manage a single 18650 
                Li-ion cell by providing over-voltage, under-voltage, 
                over-current, short-circuit, and temperature protection. 
                The BATMAN IC continuously monitors cell voltage, 
                charge/discharge current through a sense resistor, and cell 
                temperature via an external NTC thermistor. 
                Two external MOSFETs are driven by BATMAN to disconnect 
                the battery from the system load when unsafe conditions 
                are detected. Status outputs such as CHG, DSG, and LD provide 
                the system controller with real-time 
                information about battery and load state. 
                In the broader scope of the project, this subsystem forms the core of the power supply block, 
                ensuring user safety and protecting all downstream electronics. By isolating fault 
                conditions at the battery level, BATMAN improves overall system reliability 
                and allows the FM transceiver to operate safely from a removable high-energy Li-ion cell.

              <p>The S-1172 voltage regulator stage used to condition battery power for the rest of the system. 
                The regulator takes the protected battery output (PREBAT) and produces a stable, 
                regulated supply rail for sensitive electronics downstream. Input and output capacitors are 
                placed close to the device to ensure stability, suppress noise, and handle transient current demands. 
                The ON/OFF pin allows the regulator to be cleanly enabled or disabled as part of the system power-up sequence. 
                By regulating the inherently variable voltage of an 18650 Li-ion cell, this stage prevents brownouts 
                and over-voltage stress on digital and RF components. In the broader scope of the project, 
                this schematic sits directly after the BATMAN battery manager and acts as the final power conditioning 
                step. Together, these blocks ensure the transceiver operates reliably across the full battery discharge curve.</p>

              <p>The battery voltage monitoring circuit measures the protected battery rail and provides a low-power, MCU-readable representation of remaining charge. A high-value resistor divider scales the battery voltage while minimizing continuous current draw. The TC75 op-amp buffers this divided signal, presenting a stable, low-impedance output that is insensitive to ADC loading. This buffered voltage is then fed into the MCP3021 I²C ADC for digitization. The ADC allows the microcontroller to periodically sample battery voltage without directly loading the battery or analog node. In the broader system, this block enables battery percentage estimation and low-battery warning functionality while preserving overall power efficiency.</p>

Multiple power and ground pins are used to properly isolate digital and analog domains and reduce noise sensitivity. Programming and debugging are supported through dedicated ICSP lines. External interrupts allow responsive, event-driven input handling without continuous polling. In the broader project, this device acts as the central controller that ties together the RF, power management, audio, and user interface subsystems.

Dedicated control lines handle reset, data/command selection, chip select, and backlight control. This separation of control and data signals allows for efficient screen updates and flexible display operation. The backlight enable line allows brightness control or power savings when the display is not needed. In the overall project, this module serves as the main user interface, presenting information such as battery level, operating mode, and channel selection.

Each pushbutton is biased from the battery rail and uses an RC network to debounce the mechanical switch action. The resulting signals are routed directly to dedicated external interrupt pins, enabling immediate, event-driven response. One dual-switch device is used to reduce component count while maintaining independent inputs. This approach eliminates the need for constant polling and reduces processor overhead. In the broader system, this block provides responsive user control for mode selection, adjustments, and transmit/receive operation.</p>

The interface follows Microchip’s standard ICSP pinout for compatibility with common programming tools. Keeping this header on the board simplifies iteration and troubleshooting.

A pull-up resistor holds the reset line high under normal operation, while the pushbutton allows manual assertion of reset. An RC network introduces a brief delay at startup to prevent false triggering during supply ramp-up. A series resistor protects the reset pin and improves signal integrity. The jumper allows flexibility during development or troubleshooting by modifying reset behavior. In the overall system, this block guarantees predictable boot behavior and reliable recovery from fault conditions.

By filtering disturbances close to the load, the circuit protects against erratic behavior and resets. In the broader project, this block is critical for reliable operation of the microcontroller and mixed-signal peripherals.

Digital control and data exchange with the microcontroller are handled through a serial interface, allowing dynamic configuration of frequency, mode, and power. Audio input from the microphone is AC-coupled into the transceiver, while received audio is routed out for amplification.
