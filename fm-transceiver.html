    <h1>FM Transceiver</h1>

    <p>
      A low-power FM transceiver system designed around the Silicon Labs
      Si4027 RF transceiver IC, focusing on RF hardware integration,
      mixed-signal PCB design, and digital control of RF devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of this project was to design and integrate a
      functional FM transmitter and receiver using a commercially
      available RF transceiver IC, while developing practical experience
      with RF-aware PCB layout and digital configuration of RF hardware.
    </p>

    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The system consists of a custom-designed PCB hosting the Si4027
      transceiver IC, supporting RF passives, audio input and output
      stages, and a digital control interface. The board is housed in a
      dedicated enclosure with external user controls and indicators.

    <h2>Transceiver IC Selection</h2>
    <p>
      The Silicon Labs Si4027 was selected due to its integrated FM
      transmit and receive functionality, low power operation, and
      suitability for short-range RF experimentation without requiring
      fully discrete RF stages.
    </p>

    <h2>PCB Design & Hardware Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The PCB was designed with attention to RF layout considerations,
      including component placement around the transceiver, separation
      of analog, digital, and RF sections, and grounding strategies to
      reduce noise coupling. External connectors were provided for
      control, audio I/O, and system testing.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital Control & Initialization</h2>
    <p>
      The Si4027 is configured through a serial digital control interface
      requiring correct timing, polarity, and configuration bit
      selection during device initialization. Firmware was developed to
      handle device startup and register configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>Integration Issue & Root Cause</h2>
    <p>
      During system integration, the transceiver failed to initialize
      correctly. Investigation identified an incorrect configuration of
      the control interface polarity bit, resulting in invalid
      communication with the Si4027 during initialization. As a result,
      the RF device could not be brought into an operational state
      within the available project timeline.
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging & Engineering Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict adherence to RF IC digital interface timing and polarity requirements is critical</li>
      <li>Small configuration errors can prevent full system bring-up despite correct hardware</li>
      <li>Early validation of control interfaces can reduce late-stage integration risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Correct control interface polarity configuration and reattempt device initialization</li>
      <li>Validate digital signaling using logic analysis during bring-up</li>
      <li>Characterize RF performance after successful initialization</li>
    </ul>
